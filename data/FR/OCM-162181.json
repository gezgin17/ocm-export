        "AccessComments": "The two chargers are next to the reception. There is a parking area for cleaning mobil homes and adjusting car pressure. Right at the entrance from the camp ground. The charging is separated from the street by a guard. Only if you are allowed to go on the campsite, you are allowed to charge. Maybe you can find an agreement with the Camping company. They are very friendly and very customer oriented. It is a very big five star camp ground with an own nice and clean beach stretch, supermarket, restaurants shops etc...Forgot to ask for price, but assume it is free for customers. The chargers are not yet listed on the website. The system looked very new.",
