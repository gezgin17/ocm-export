    "GeneralComments": "This is a combined CCS/ChaDeMo/AC charging spot, up to 50 kW charging. Both the parking and use is free (November 2015). Tried it with a BMW i3, using CCS, and I got around 34 kW (probably limited by the car). I didn't try the AC or ChaDeMo. AC says 43 kW, not sure which connector it actually is. For access: Drive up to the gate, and wait for security to see you. They will open the gate and help you into the spot (you have to park right up against the wall). They are very helpful, and it's totally free.",
