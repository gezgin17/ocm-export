When inside, keep in the RIGHT lane, as the left lane is blocked from entering carpark (entrance/exit is on the right). If you enter from the expressway anyway, it's OK, but you have to drive for a while until you get to the parking. Do NOT follow \"station parking\", follow \"Maritime Square Parking\" (some of the way it is the same direction)",
