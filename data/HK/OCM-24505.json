The position of this marker is EXACTLY where the entrance is. Some of the other nearby locations might be the same (a duplicate), but in that case, both location and name is wrong. There are many shopping malls in Sha Tin, this one I used is \"New Town Plaza Phase I\"",

Staff was very helpful to call the owner over the speaker system, allow us to park in front of the Audi, lend us an extension cable. Later they called us so we could move the car correctly into position and remove the extension cable. The staff was very helpful and enthusiastic.",
