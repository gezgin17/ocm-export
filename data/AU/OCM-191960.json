The Veefil will show err 32/39 until power is established.  Operate the Veefil as normal: Plug in as soon as the error clears and the \"ready to charge\" symbol flashes on the left side of the charger panel. Press the Start button on the charger control panel, press stop when finished and return the charger plug to its holster.   Lift the generator flap and switch off, then wait for the generator to idle for 30 seconds and stop.  Lock the flap with the combo lock and donate to https://chuffed.org/project/the-big-lap-has-gaps-lets-plug-one-big-gap-to-unite-the-nation"
