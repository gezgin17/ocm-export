Then, after 10 mins I received an email on my phone telling me that charging had stopped due to an error.  Returned to car and no error evident, but also not charging.  Tried to get charging going again a couple of times but never got past checking systems message, and was never prompted once for ecotricity card.  Charged 29% in the 10 mins it was charging ok, and that was enough to get me home, so didn't take any further action.\r\nCharge 25% at 16:16 to 54% at 16:26 - 29% in 10 mins - when it was working.\r\n",

Charge station was being used by a Nissan Leaf (CHAdeMO), and it looked like I couldn't start charging my Zoe (Mennekes) without stopping the charging of the Leaf, so waited. (i.e. it might look like two charging station, but really it's only one).  The Leaf owner turned up after less than 10 mins, and after a nice chat he left.  Successfully charged approx 50% in 15 mins.",
