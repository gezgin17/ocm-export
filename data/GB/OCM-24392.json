            "Comment": "Offline all last week (despite calling chargemaster). Looked ok tonight but returning 3 hours later, no charge on car. Worryingly, system had also allowed cable to be taken. This has happened a lot before the out of order problem of last week. Would now consider this unit as unusable and to be avoided despite blue lights.",
